<p>Player can pick up cubes and keep score. Game shows "You Win!" text after player picks up all cubes.</p>
<p>It was super helpful that I already knew Javascript and some game logic from old projects such my Star Wars space shooter game made with HTML Canvas.</p>
<p>The helpful tutorial I used that <a href="https://www.mvcode.com/lessons/roll-a-ball-in-unity-5-c">compared Javascript and C#.</a></p>
